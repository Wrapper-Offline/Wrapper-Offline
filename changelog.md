# Wrapper: Offline Changelog
This changelog is based off [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) and ~~somewhat but not really~~ adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). If you have no idea what that means, basically this changelog is formatted in a specific consistent way, and version numbers are formatted as X.Y.Z, X being a major not-backwards-compatible update, Y being a feature update, and X being bug fixes.

### What do I care about
This update basically has file uploading. New TTS voices have been added, including Eric and Jennifer. The headgear section works now. Waveforms work now. Mega Comedy World 2 has been added. An FAQ is now included with Wrapper. The launcher is far more stable now, as you can tell from all the entries that start with the word Launcher.
### Added
  - File uploading!!!...kinda. It's more of a workaround.
  - Loads of new TTS voices (yes this means eric and jennifer)
  - Mega Comedy World 2 by Blukas/GoTube
  - Functioning waveforms (credit to creepyjokes2000)
  - Headgear sections (credit to JoshAnimate)

  - Folder in utilities that stores files to remember certain events

  - Dry run option for testing launcher easier
  - Non-admin HTTPS cert install option (but admin is still preferred)
  - Source code of programs is now included in utilities folder
  - Chromium now includes Requestly and Stylus extensions
  - Copy of JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler included
  - Upgrade script
### Changed
  - Turned on "use gpu" in Flash attributes. May or may not do anything, who knows
  - Settings is now interactive (text version still in utilities\config.bat, but you probably shouldn't mess with it)
  - Heavily modified the README (mostly simplifying and moving things to faq.txt)
  - Video list mostly redone
  - Server page redone
  - HTTPS cert now also applies to server ports both 4664 and 4343
  - HTTPS cert now expires on 9999-12-31 instead of 4343-04-03, just to be extra sure that by the time it expires technology will have advanced so far that HTTPS will only exist as a relic of history and most if not all of Wrapper: Offline's functions will only be possible in an emulated version of today's technology. if that prediction turns out to be completely false someone can just renew it and be done so 10,000s kids can still make grounded videos on youtube

  - HTML injection was possible via the Upload a Movie button
  - More voices should now fit within the character limit
  - All scripts use UTF-8 to prevent special character crashes
  - Server's port is now 4664 instead of 4343, Wrapper port is 4343 instead of 80 (hopefully will prevent EADDRINUSE errors)
  - Launcher now closes any running Node.js processes (hopefully also prevents EADDRINUSE)
